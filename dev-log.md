## Technical Decisions

### Tech Stack (Selected)

- **Backend Framework**: Node.js + Express.js

  - Chosen for its robust ecosystem, excellent package support, and strong community
  - Great performance for API-driven applications
  - Rich middleware ecosystem for various functionalities
  - Easy integration with modern frontend frameworks

- **Database**: PostgreSQL

  - Robust relational database with JSON support
  - Perfect for complex relationships between recipes, ingredients, and users
  - Strong querying capabilities for recipe search and filtering
  - Excellent data integrity and transaction support

- **Authentication**: JWT + Custom Implementation

  - Full control over authentication flow
  - Cost-effective solution
  - Stateless authentication for better scalability
  - Flexibility to integrate third-party services in the future

- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
  - Industry standard documentation
  - Interactive API testing interface
  - Can be automatically generated from code comments
  - Great developer experience for API consumers

### Initial Setup Requirements

- Node.js (Latest LTS version)
- PostgreSQL (Latest stable version)
- npm or yarn for package management
- Development environment variables management (dotenv)

### Key Dependencies (Planned)

- express: Web framework
- pg/sequelize: PostgreSQL client/ORM
- jsonwebtoken: JWT authentication
- bcrypt: Password hashing
- swagger-ui-express: API documentation
- jest: Testing framework
- eslint & prettier: Code quality and formatting

## Daily Log

### [Current Date]

- Created initial project structure
- Set up development log to track progress
- Decided on tech stack:
  - Node.js + Express.js for backend
  - PostgreSQL for database
  - JWT for authentication
  - Swagger for API documentation
- Next steps: Initialize Node.js project and set up basic Express server

## Notes & Ideas

- Consider implementing barcode scanning for easy ingredient input
- Think about recipe scaling functionality
- Plan for ingredient substitution suggestions
- Consider integration with popular grocery delivery services
